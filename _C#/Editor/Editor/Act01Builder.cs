//  The Frayed Red String
//  Act01Builder.cs  (Editor only)
//
//  Act one — Cherry Blossom Mirage (桜の幻) — written out as code.
//
//  Run it once from The Frayed Red String ▸ Build Act 01 From The Story
//  Document. It writes Assets/Story/Acts/Act01.asset, reusing the asset already
//  at that path if there is one.
//
//  ===========================================================================
//  WHAT THIS REWRITE FIXED, AND WHY IT WAS WORTH REWRITING
//  ===========================================================================
//
//  The draft this replaces was funny. That is not the reason it was replaced,
//  and most of its jokes are still here — the cat, the plant, the dango, the
//  teacher's "maybe", the machine that eats coins. What was wrong with it was
//  underneath the jokes:
//
//   1. IT WAS SET IN APRIL. The narrative document opens the game on the 2nd of
//      September 2024, in the first week of the SECOND term. The old act was
//      written in spring: cherry blossom on every other page, a girl worrying
//      about a brand new uniform, "the first day of high school" in its own
//      scene notes. The game's own locked facts forbid that last phrase
//      outright, because the whole point of a second-term opening is that a
//      Japanese player assumes the two of them made up "-pi" last term.
//
//   2. THE BLOSSOM WAS REAL. The act is called Cherry Blossom Mirage. A mirage
//      is a thing that is not there. If the path to school is actually full of
//      blossom then the title is a description, and the game has told the
//      player the truth on the title card — which is the one thing it must not
//      do. The alley is now full of dead leaves and nobody mentions it.
//
//   3. THEY WERE IN A UNIFORM NOBODY HAS DRAWN. All sixty character sprites
//      have these two in one outfit each, and neither of them is a uniform:
//      she is in a pink and blue frilled dress with a red cord at her wrists,
//      he is in a cream cardigan and grey trousers. The old act's opening
//      joke — the new uniform is a bit loose — pointed at something that is
//      not on screen, which is the scene lock broken in thirty seconds.
//
//      The replacement is better rather than merely correct: a girl worrying
//      about a dress she chose says more about her than a girl worrying about
//      a uniform the school chose. She picked it. Somebody has to approve of it.
//
//   4. THE ONE SCENE THAT HAD A JOB DID NOT DO IT. Friday's classmate exists
//      for exactly one reason: ぴ is real slang and a Japanese player hears the
//      whole of it the first time, where a Persian or English player hears a
//      nickname. So somebody outside the pair has to notice it out loud, once.
//      In the old act, Yua's last "Haru-pi" was six frames before the classmate
//      arrived, and the line immediately before the question was about a manga.
//      The player attached "what did you just call him?" to the manga. The
//      device fired at nothing.
//
//  ===========================================================================
//  THE RULES THIS ACT IS WRITTEN UNDER
//  ===========================================================================
//
//  Dialogue manual version eight, and above every other rule in it:
//
//      If this game had no secret in it at all, and were only a sweet high
//      school romance — would this scene be fun to play?
//
//  Acts one to four have to genuinely BE the cute game, not do an impression of
//  one. The fifth act is devastating only in proportion to how much the player
//  enjoyed the first. Concretely:
//
//    • Half of every scene, at least, is about a third thing. A teacher neither
//      of them has met, a bakery that changed hands, a cat, four dango on a
//      stick, a plant nobody named. Two people who only talk about each other
//      sound like an interrogation.
//    • Every frame carries warmth, a joke, excitement, stubbornness,
//      embarrassment, curiosity, a complaint or an offer. A frame that only
//      moves information is deleted.
//    • Line length is information. Every scene has at least one genuinely long
//      line — somebody excited about something and unwilling to drop it — and
//      several one-word ones.
//    • Haru wins one unimportant argument per scene and quietly loses one real
//      decision. Neither is ever named. If replacing all of his answers with
//      "okay" does not change the scene, he is not in it.
//    • Yua does at least one thing per scene that has nothing to do with Haru.
//    • The dread budget for the whole act is ten moments: one Monday, one
//      Tuesday, one Wednesday, two Thursday, two Friday, three Saturday. Zero
//      in the first fifty frames. Each is deniable with an ordinary sentence,
//      and all ten are listed by name in the self-audit at the foot of the file.
//    • The escalation ladder reaches rung three and stops. Knowing too much,
//      then a reaction half a degree too big, then — once, on the last day —
//      correcting his memory and being right. Rungs four and five belong to
//      act two and are not touched here.
//    • No clinical symptom is performed directly. Hypervigilance is not a line
//      about exits; it is half a second of silence when something hums under a
//      grate, and then she carries on.
//    • Nobody is ever surprised that the other one knows something, and nobody
//      ever explains how they know. Between two old friends, knowing is
//      ordinary. The player is meant to notice that nobody ever asks.
//    • Scene lock. A line may only point at something visible in the current
//      background, visible in the current sprite, or named in full earlier in
//      this same scene. Going somewhere is discussed before the background
//      changes, never after.
//    • Every choice in the act is white and none is counted. Blue and green do
//      not exist until act three and are not hinted at. But each white option
//      has real script behind it, because a choice the game does not answer
//      teaches the player across an hour that pressing things is pointless —
//      which is the one belief act two's refused blue button cannot afford.
//
//  Three languages, three performances, never three translations. What stays
//  constant is the information, the power, the pulse and where the pauses fall.
//  What changes is idiom, particles, register and where the joke lands.
//
//  What the design document is quiet about, and this script keeps quiet: the
//  player is meant to believe these two met this morning. They do not behave
//  like it, they are already "-pi" to one another in the first exchange, and
//  nothing explains why for another five acts.

        //     Date         Friday 6 September, evening.
        //     On stage     The seats, the machine, the stall, the track.
        //     In hand      One stick of dango with four on it.

        //  ぴ is real Japanese slang and a Japanese player gets the whole of it
        //  the first time Yua says it in the opening scene. A Persian or English
        //  player hears a nickname and nothing else. So once, and only once,
        //  somebody outside the pair has to notice it out loud and be told to
        //  mind their own business — and the suffix acquires in two languages
        //  the weight it already had in the third.
        //
        //  The previous draft put six frames and a manga between Yua's last
        //  "Haru-pi" and the classmate's question, so the question landed on the
        //  manga instead. Here the suffix is the line immediately before, it is
        //  said at normal volume in front of somebody who is standing right
        //  there, and the classmate interrupts on it.

        //  flat, and then she is completely normal again. Deniable: she was

        //  SHAPE
        //    6 days · 14 scenes · 458 written frames that show text · 9 white
        //    choices, EVERY ONE OF WHICH BRANCHES. A single playthrough reads
        //    between 418 and 424 of the 458, because it only walks one road of
        //    each pair and both roads are counted above.
        //
        //    Eight of the nine used to be a button that produced a Choice beat
        //    and nothing else: the player pressed, the game moved on, and one
        //    of them — "eat it now" — was followed on the next frame by Yua
        //    saying they were saving the rolls for lunch. The first button in
        //    the game did nothing and said so to the player's face.
        //
        //    Every road is Yua's. She is the protagonist; the white options are
        //    her deciding something, they land on her lines, and not one of
        //    them changes a word Haru would have said on his own.
        //
        //    No blue or green anywhere. No player address. No aside. Nothing
        //    above ladder rung three.
        //
        //  THE TEN DREAD MOMENTS, AND THE ORDINARY SENTENCE THAT EXPLAINS EACH
        //    1  Mon, the corner, last two frames. "Good. / Still the same."
        //         → she is fond of him.            [rung 1]
        //    2  Tue, the bakery. She says what is on a collar she refused to
        //       read. → she looked at it another day.                 [rung 1]
        //    3  Wed, the roof. HIS. He puts his bag on the left end before she
        //       says anything; she sits on the right without looking.
        //         → they are used to each other.                      [rung 1]
        //    4  Thu, the café. She orders him a drink he has never said he
        //       likes and tells him to finish it. → she is being nice.[rung 2]
        //    5  Thu, the alley. Something hums under the road and she stops
        //       mid-sentence for under a second. → she lost her thread.
        //                                                             [rung 2]
        //    6  Fri, the platform. Her face for two tenths of a second while a
        //       third person stands close to him. → nobody saw it.    [rung 2]
        //    7  Fri, the platform. "It's ours", a beat early and a degree flat.
        //         → she was embarrassed. Which is also true.          [rung 2]
        //    8  Sat, the playground. One flat syllable on "five" in the middle
        //       of being completely lovely. → she was concentrating.  [rung 2]
        //    9  Sat, the corner. She corrects his memory of his own childhood
        //       and is right. → he told her once and forgot.          [rung 3]
        //   10  Sat, the corner, last two frames. "Six days. / Nothing's
        //       changed at all." → she had a nice week.               [rung 3]
        //
        //    Zero in the first fifty frames: the first is frame 112.
        //    Never two rungs in one scene. No rung skipped: 1 before 2, 2
        //    before 3. Rungs 4 and 5 are untouched and belong to act two.
        //
        //    One thing that is NOT on the list and was checked: on Monday, in
        //    the classroom, she says "Good." about a seat he took without being
        //    asked, and then says she meant the curtain. That is not a dread
        //    moment — a girl saying "good" about where her friend sat is not
        //    strange in any way, and nothing in the frame is wrong. It is there
        //    so that the same word, alone, at the end of the same day, has been
        //    heard before. The strangeness is created backwards, eleven hours
        //    later, and only on a second playthrough.

        //  HARU WINS ONE UNIMPORTANT ARGUMENT PER SCENE
        //    the shade · plants do not get names · the window has been broken
        //    since last year · the sausage has six legs · "mm" was one sound ·
        //    the hydrangeas · which side of the path goes faster · the orange
        //    trains · it is a leaf in the shape of a hat.
        //
        //  AND LOSES ONE REAL DECISION PER SCENE, UNREMARKED
        //    where they eat the rolls · where they sit in class · which way
        //    they walk home · that they go past the bakery · which table in the
        //    café · what he drinks · that he finishes it · which dango is his ·
        //    that the plant has a name.
        //
        //  YUA DOES SOMETHING WITH NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM, EVERY SCENE
        //    the hem · the plant · hitting the machine · the angle of the rain
        //    · naming the cat and the whole speech about not reading the collar
        //    · the leaf on the angel · the two children on the slide · Tomo.
        //
        //  THE SUBSTITUTION TEST
        //    Replace every one of Haru's answers with "okay" and the act loses:
        //    both bakeries, the dough, Morita-sensei's maybe and its payoff,
        //    the broken window, the orange trains, six-legged octopuses, the
        //    hat, and the slide. He is in it.
        //
        //  MOTIFS
        //    The plant     Mon plain · Wed repeat · Sat paid off as Tomo.
        //    The machine   Mon takes a coin · Sat gives two cans.
        //    The test      Mon "maybe" · Tue argued · Thu he was right.
        //    The left      His bag Wed · the flat side of the path Fri · the
        //                  hand he put down at the end of the slide Sat.
        //                  Never once remarked on by anybody.

        //  CONTINUITY

        //    Weather: maple leaves, light, outdoors only, never in a room and
        //    never once mentioned by anybody. No blossom anywhere in the act.
        //    Clothes: her dress and his cardigan, which is what is drawn. No
        //    uniform is referred to at any point.
        //    Bento numbers: six and four said once, ten pictures, four and
        //    three onto his lid — the frames and the line agree.
        //    Sounds: the school bell twice, Mon and Fri, both on the path.
        //    The machine Mon (takes) and Sat (pays out twice). A chair Mon, a
        //    knock on the machine Mon, the thing under the road Thu. Counted,
        //    not remembered: nine cues in the act.
        //    Weather by scene: leaves outdoors in daylight only. Never in a
        //    room — not the classroom, not the corridor, not the café — and
        //    never at night, which is both of the night scenes.
        //
        //  WHAT THIS ACT PLANTS FOR LATER, AND HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
        //    · "-pi", from the first exchange, never explained.        (act 6)
        //    · Nobody ever asks how the other one knows anything.      (act 6)
        //    · His leg: four floors, out of breath, "don't take the stairs fast
        //      on the way down", the hand at the end of the slide.  (acts 2, 6)
        //    · The thing under the road, once, for less than a second.  (act 6)
        //    · The red cord at her wrists, in every sprite, never named. (act 5)
        //    · Five: counted out loud for two children who are not listening.
        //                                                            (the end)
        //    All of them two lines or fewer, mid-sentence, with no pause after.
        //
        //  WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
        //    No blue or green button and no hint of one — act three.
        //    No line to the player — act two's last scene.
        //    Nobody is ever surprised that the other one knows something, and
        //    nobody explains how they know. The player is meant to notice that
        //    nobody asks. The characters never notice at all.
